# Predict-Employee-Attrition
 Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning
This project leverages the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company. It combines machine learning, model interpretability, and actionable insights to help HR departments make data-driven retention decisions.
Dataset
Source: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset
Target Variable: Attrition (Yes/No)
Project Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understand the dataset
Visualize feature distributions
Identify trends related to attrition
2. Model Building
Trained classification models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
3. Model Explainability
Used SHAP to explain model predictions
Highlighted key features impacting attrition:
Overtime
Job Satisfaction
Years at Company
Environment Satisfaction
4. Actionable HR Insights
Limit excessive overtime
Enhance job satisfaction through feedback and engagement
Provide clear career progression and internal mobility
Focus retention efforts on high-risk employee segments
